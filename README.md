# Welcome to My GitHub Profile 👋

Hi there! I'm a passionate student of **Network Security** with a keen interest in exploring different aspects of cybersecurity, network management, and software development. I am currently working on several projects that involve vulnerability detection, brute-force attacks, intrusion detection systems, and much more.

## About Me 👨‍💻

- 🌱 I’m currently learning and exploring **network security**, **ethical hacking**, and **vulnerability detection**.
- 🔭 I’m working on a **Vulnerability Detection System** for my **Final Year Project (FYP)**.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love combining **technology** with **art**, which is part of my unique business concept, **Byte & Bite**, blending tech services and food.
- 🌍 I am based in **Malaysia** and currently pursuing my **Diploma in Network Security**.
- 🎂 My birthday is on **April 19th**!

## 📚 Projects

Here are some of the key projects I am working on:

### 1. **InjecXcanner**
   A **Vulnerability Detection Program (VDP)** focused on **SQL injection** vulnerability detection. It's designed to help developers spot vulnerabilities in their applications.

### 2. **Brute-Force & Sniffing Lab**
   A lab project simulating **brute-force attacks** on common protocols (FTP, SSH, TELNET) and analyzing **network traffic** using tools like **Wireshark** and **Hydra**. 

### 3. **CIT 0592: Intrusion Detection/Prevention System Mini Project**
   A hands-on project where I simulate an attack and use **IDS/IPS** and other security tools to detect and prevent it.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

I work with various tools and technologies, including:

- **XAMPP** for database management
- **Wireshark** and **Nessus** for network traffic analysis and vulnerability scanning
- **Burp Suite**, **Hydra**, and **Metasploit** for penetration testing
- **GitHub** for version control and project collaboration
- **Linux** and **Rocky Linux** for system and network security tasks
